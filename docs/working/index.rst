Working with WSIM
=================

WSIM functionality can be accessed in multiple forms, depending on the desired levels of customization and automation.

- Through the :doc:`workflow/index` tools, users can run automated processes to produce :doc:`/concepts/composite_indices` and other outputs from standardized WSIM configurations.
- With the :doc:`scripts/index` tools, users can perform core operations of WSIM (distribution fitting, anomaly computation, land surface modeling, etc.), customizing the datasets and parameters used for each operation.
- Using the :doc:`r_packages/index`, users can integrate WSIM functionality into their own code.
