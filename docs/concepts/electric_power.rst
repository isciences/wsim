Electric Power Assessment
#########################

The WSIM electric power assessment estimates the risk of electrical generation loss due to hydrologic and temperature anomalies.

The following types of losses are considered by WSIM:

- hydroelectric generation losses due to low flow
- thermoelectric generation losses due to 

  - insufficient water for cooling
  - high water temperature
  - low air temperature
  - high air temperature

Losses are calculated for individual power plants and then aggregated to provinces, countries, and hydrologic basins for reporting.

Calculating Hydrologic Anomalies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The electric power assessment uses total blue water, calculated at the level of hydrologic basins, as an indicator of water quantity.
Runoff for each basin is computed from the pixel-based land surface model outputs using `exactextract <https://github.com/isciences/exactextract>`_.
Total blue water is calculated for each basin by accumulating each basin's runoff into the downstream basin to which it is linked by an ID reference.
Total blue water values are time-integrated by summing total blue water over multiple months.
A statistical distribution is fit for each basin and time-integration period, which can then be used to calculate the return period associated with an individual total blue water value.

A relevant time-integration period is determined for each basin by considering the effect of water storage.
When water is available in reservoirs in and upstream of a basin, the impact of short-term water deficits may be reduced by releasing stored water.
On the other hand, after a long period of water deficits, downstream availability may continue to be low while the storage capacity is replenished.
Cumulative upstream storage capacity is computed for each basin using the Global Reservoir and Dam (GRanD) database :cite:`Lehner:2011`.

Not all reservoirs provide storage that is available to downstream electric power generation.
Reservoirs used for irrigation, flood control, and water supply are excluded from the upstream storage calculation unless they are explicitly coded as used for electric power generation.
For each basin, cumulative upstream storage is the capacity of all available reservoirs in any upstream basin, plus the capacity of any available reservoirs in the basin of interest.
Cumulative upstream storage is converted to months of storage by dividing the total storage capacity by median annual total blue water and multiplying by 12.

A basin's cumulative upstream storage capacity determines the time period over which total blue water is evaluated when computing return periods within that basin.
For a basin with â‰¤ 1 month of storage capacity, the total blue water return period for a given month is based on the distribution of annual minimum total blue water.
For a basin with 3 or 6 months of storage capacity, the return period is based on the distribution of annual minimum 3-month or 6-month sums of total blue water.
For basins with 12, 24, or 36 months of storage capacity, return periods are based on the distributions of 12-, 24-, and 36-month sums of total blue water for time periods ending in the month of December.

The algorithms applied to hydroelectric and thermoelectric (water-cooled) power plants are described below.

Hydroelectric Generation Losses from Hydrologic Anomalies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Hydropower loss risk is taken to be directly related to total blue water (:math:`\mathrm{Bt}`) expressed as a proportion of the median total blue water sum for the period ending in the current month (the number of months included in the sum is determined using the procedure described above.):

.. math::

   \mathrm{Bt}_{ratio} = \frac{\mathrm{Bt_{observed}}}{\mathrm{Bt}_{median}}

A loss model was developed based on annual hydropower generation data for California from 1983 through 2012 :cite:`California_Energy_Commission:2013`. The form of the model is described by the following equation:

.. math::

   \mathrm{loss} = 1 - \left(\frac{\textrm{Bt}_{observed}}{\textrm{Bt}_{median}}\right)^{H}

A value of :math:`H = 0.6` was determined based on initial applications to global data.
The hydropower loss risk curve is illustrated in :numref:`hydropower_loss_function` below:

Water-Cooled Generation Losses from Hydrologic Anomalies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Water-cooled power plants are designed to handle some degree of hydrologic anomalies.
Intake pipes, for example, are set deep enough in the source body of water so that moderate fluctuations in water level do not expose the intakes and thus reduce the quantity of water that can be extracted.
For example, if seasonal low water typically occurs in the summer, then low water anomalies in January may not be of consequence if flows remain above summer levels.
Because of this expectation of variability, return periods used in estimating losses from thermoelectric plants are computed by comparing total blue water to the distribution of annual minimum total blue water, rather than the distribution of total blue water for the month being evaluated.

When hydrologic anomalies pose a risk to water-cooled power generation, it is expected that loss of electrical generating capacity will more severe in basins experiencing water stress.
The basic form of the loss risk model used for water-cooled plants includes this feature.
The mathematical form of the algorithm is:

.. math::

   \mathrm{loss} = A^{\left(\bar{X}-X_c\right)}-1, \ \mathrm{where} \ A = e^{\left(\frac{\ln{101}}{X_{\mathrm{max}}-X_c}\right)}

where :math:`\bar{X}` is the basin-level return period for integrated total blue water, :math:`X_c` is the basin-level period at which loss begins to occur, and :math:`X_{\mathrm{max}}` is the return period associated with complete loss.   

Parameters :math:`X_c` and :math:`X_{\mathrm{max}}` are set for each basin as a function of water stress, defined as the ratio of water withdrawals to total blue water in a given basin.
Water stress is not calculated by WSIM and must be imported from another source such as `Aqueduct <https://www.wri.org/our-work/project/aqueduct>`_.
Higher water stress suggests less resilience to hydrologic anomalies, so the onset of loss occurs sooner.
For example, if normal water use is 98% of the typical blue water level, even small reductions in total blue water will have an impact.
The value of :math:`X_c` is determined by linear interpolation among the values in the table below, as shown in :numref:`onset_graph`.

+------------+--+----+---+---+---+
|Water Stress|0 | 0.1|0.2|0.4|0.8|
+============+==+====+===+===+===+

The return period associated with total loss :math:`X_{\mathrm{max}}` is taken to be :math:`X_c + 30`. :numref:`water_cooled_loss_graph` shows the output of the loss function for a basin with no water stress (dotted line) and a basin with maximum water stress (solid line).

Temperature-based losses
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The electric power assessment includes an estimation of generation losses due to temperature anomalies.
The following factors are considered:

* low air temperatures, which can cause equipment failure or freezing of equipment, piping, and/or fuel stockpiles;
* high air temperatures, which reduce the efficiency of generation and transmission; and
* high water temperatures, under which generation must be reduced to comply with effluent temperature regulations.

The temperature loss function uses three WSIM outputs as inputs:

+--------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|Parameter     |Description                                                             |
+==============+========================================================================+
|:math:`T`     |Air temperature at plant                                                |
+--------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|:math:`T_{rp}`|Air temperature anomaly at plant, expressed as a return period          |
+--------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|:math:`T_{Bt}`|Average air temperature in basin, weighted by total blue water          |
+--------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Due to the lack of globally consistent temporal water temperature data, the mean parameters of a set of linear models by Segura et al. (2015) are used to compute water temperature :math:`T_w` from air temperature :math:`T_a`:

.. math::
   T_w = 2.5 + 0.76T_a

Temperature is assumed to equilibrate such that upstream water temperature can be ignored at the monthly time scape used for the electricity assessment.

The temperature loss function depends on several parameters:

+----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------+

The loss function is defined as follows:

.. math::

   \mathrm{loss} = \begin{cases}
   0.03\left(T_c - T\right)                                  & T < T_c \ \mathrm{and} \ T_{rp} < -30 \\
   0.005\left(T - T_{eff}\right)                             & \left(T_{reg}-T_{diff}\right) < T < T_{eff} \\
   \frac{T-\left(T_{reg} - T_{diff}\right)}{T_{reg}-T_{diff}} & T > \left(T_{reg}-T_{diff}\right)
   \end{cases}
