	abstract = {A Global Land Data Assimilation System ({GLDAS}) has been developed. Its purpose is to ingest satellite- and ground-based observational data products, using advanced land surface modeling and data assimilation techniques, in order to generate optimal fields of land surface states and fluxes. {GLDAS} is unique in that it is an uncoupled land surface modeling system that drives multiple models, integrates a huge quantity of observation-based data, runs globally at high resolution (0.25°), and produces results in near–real time (typically within 48 h of the present). {GLDAS} is also a test bed for innovative modeling and assimilation capabilities. A vegetation-based “tiling” approach is used to simulate subgrid-scale variability, with a 1-km global vegetation dataset as its basis. Soil and elevation parameters are based on high-resolution global datasets. Observation-based precipitation and downward radiation and output fields from the best available global coupled atmospheric data assimilation systems are employed as forcing data. The high-quality, global land surface fields provided by {GLDAS} will be used to initialize weather and climate prediction models and will promote various hydrometeorological studies and applications. The ongoing {GLDAS} archive (started in 2001) of modeled and observed, global, surface meteorological data, parameter maps, and output is publicly available.},
